# FloraWise
FloraWise is an AI-powered web application for plant recognition and disease detection using deep learning. The project leverages TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit to classify plant species and detect diseases from leaf images. By providing real-time predictions, FloraWise aims to assist farmers, botanists, and researchers in early disease diagnosis and improving agricultural productivity.
## Features
**Plant Species Recognition**: Identifies plant species from leaf images.

**Disease Detection**: Detects plant diseases and provides actionable insights.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Enables easy image uploads for real-time classification.

**Deep Learning Model**: Trained on a large dataset using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).

**Streamlit Deployment**: Web-based interactive UI for seamless user experience.
